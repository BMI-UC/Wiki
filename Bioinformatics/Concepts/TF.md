[Transcription factors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor)
(TFs) are proteins that bind to DNA and regulate transcription.

Many of the labs here at CCHMC work on transcription factors including the
[Weirauch Lab](https://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/research/divisions/a/genomics-etiology/labs/weirauch).

There are many factors that control what factors bind to which pieces of DNA,
including chromatin accessibility (histones), environmental conditions,
TF-cobinding, and TF cofactors. Assessing this binding is difficult and is
primarily done in vivo via assays like ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq.
