title: ChIP-seq
---

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (ChIP-seq) is a method to identify protein binding to DNA. The data is typically processed into [peaks](../peak-calling.md) which indicate
which regions of a reference genome are bound to the proteins of interest. 

The central limitation of ChIP-seq is that only 1 protein of interest can be studied at a
time. This means that it is prohibitively expensive to do ChIP-seq on every protein in a 
cell for a given condition.

This method is very similar in output (but not methodology) to techniques like [CUT&RUN](./CUT&RUN.md) and [CUT&TAG](./CUT&TAG.md).
