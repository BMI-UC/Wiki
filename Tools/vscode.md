Visual Studio Code is a text editor that can be configured to write almost any language.


## Connecting to the cluster

You can use the remote extension to connect your local vscode with the cluster.

Use the p1 cluster instead of the normal cluster address:

```
user@bmiclusterp1.chmcres.cchmc.org
```
