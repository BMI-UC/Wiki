## Welcome to the contribution guide!

### Pre-contribution checklist

- You'll need a [Github account](https://github.com/join) before you can contribute to the wiki.
- If you want to make more than a few contributions, please email [David Lewis](mailto:lewis3d7@mail.uc.edu) about joining the [wiki contributors team](https://github.com/orgs/BMI-UC/teams/wiki-contributers) and provide your github username.

### Editing an Existing Page

If you only want to edit an existing page, simply hit the ![[edit-icon.svg]] button at the bottom of the page. This will take you to a Github page corresponding to the current file.

### Creating a new page

Navigate to the [Github repository](https://github.com/BMI-UC/Wiki) and hit the "add file" button. Add the path to your new page at the top of the window in this format: `path/to/my/file.md`.
