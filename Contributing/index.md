## Welcome to the contribution guide!

> [!warning] DO NOT upload sensitive data to the wiki. This repository is public
> and viewable by anyone. See the sensitive data section for more info.

### Pre-contribution checklist

- You'll need a [Github account](https://github.com/join) before you can
  contribute to the wiki.
- If you want to make more than a few contributions, please email
  [David Lewis](mailto:lewis3d7@mail.uc.edu) about joining the
  [wiki contributors team](https://github.com/orgs/BMI-UC/teams/wiki-contributors)
  and provide your github username.

## Contributing to the Wiki

> [!note] If are not a member of the
> [wiki contributors team](https://github.com/orgs/BMI-UC/teams/wiki-contributors),
> you will have to create a fork of the wiki before contributing.

The wiki uses Markdown, a very simple markup language designed to make editing
as easy as possible. See [[markdown]] for more details.

### Editing an Existing Page

If you only want to edit an existing page, simply hit the ![[edit-icon.svg]]
button at the bottom of the page. This will take you to a Github page
corresponding to the current file.

### Creating a new page

Navigate to the [Github repository](https://github.com/BMI-UC/Wiki) and hit the
"add file" button. Add the path to your new page at the top of the window in
this format: `path/to/my/file.md`.

### Wiki Contributors team guidelines

- For small changes like typos, you may bypass the branch protections and commit
  your changes directly to the main branch.
- For large changes, please use the "create a new branch" setting when
  committing your changes. This way, someone can review your changes before
  adding them to the wiki.

### Contributing while not being a member

When trying to commit changes, you will be prompted by Github to "fork this
repository". Once you do that, you can freely make as many changes as you want
to your own copy of the wiki. Once you are satisfied with your changes, you can
create a pull request using the
[Pull Requests](https://github.com/BMI-UC/Wiki/pulls) tab of the Github
repository for the wiki. If you need help, contact
[David Lewis](mailto:lewis3d7@mail.uc.edu)
